### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a novice programmer, passionate about projects in Python and C++, especially creating games and plugins in Unreal Engine, as well as practical tools in Python. I sometimes work on various other projects too. I aspire to develop my hobby and learn something new.

I'm the creator of [Slendertubbies](https://seba0456.itch.io/slendertubbies).
